This is a collection of impulse response files for use in audio enhancing software which make use of convolvers. I did not create these files but have collected them from various forums and upload sites over the years.

Assuming your choice of software is [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) using the irs file of your choice is as simple as 
1. Add a convolver plugin. 
2. Press impulses > import > choose irs file.
3. Press load. 

</br> Other applications should have a similar option. Look for convolution or convolver and import irs.
